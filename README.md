# Counter-SocketIo

 This is the back end for Counter with socketIo and was made solely for the purpose of learning how to deal with web sockets.
 App: http://counter-socketio.herokuapp.com/

#### How to use it:
  - The front end is a SPA(single page aplication) without routes(for now) with a counter on the top and two buttons:
    - set counter: change the counter to the specified number in the current room
    - Go to: change your room to specified room, if the room is new create a room, otherwise display counter for new room

##### TODOs:
  - change front-end to be pretier(check client for more info)
  - <del>support for multiple rooms</del>
  - ability to change refresh rate and counter speed
  - <del>redis implementation</del>
  - create dashboard to see all rooms
  - create room button
